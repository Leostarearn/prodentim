  </div>

  <!-- Main FAQ content -->
  <div class="content-wrapper">
    <p><strong>How Does ProDentim Work?</strong><br>
      ProDentim is a unique probiotic candy designed to support your oral microbiome. It delivers beneficial bacteria directly to your mouth, helping restore the balance of good bacteria for fresher breath, stronger gums, and healthier teeth.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Can ProDentim Help with Bad Breath and Gum Problems?</strong><br>
      Yes! ProDentim is formulated with 3.5 billion probiotics plus essential minerals and plant extracts. These ingredients help reduce plaque, support gum strength, and promote long-lasting fresh breath—starting with your very first chew.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Is ProDentim Suitable for Women and Men?</strong><br>
      Absolutely. Whether you’re 25 or 65, ProDentim is safe and effective for both men and women looking to improve their dental health naturally. It’s especially helpful if you’ve experienced dry mouth, bleeding gums, or sensitivity.
